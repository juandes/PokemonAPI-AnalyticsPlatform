  <h2>Pokemon types</h2>
  <p>Types are properties for Pokemon and their moves. (write more here)
      
     A Pokemon may have either one or two types (dual type Pokemon), however their moves are still assigned
     to one type.
  </p>
  <ul>

      <li><a href="type/{{n.type}}"><h4>{{n.type}}</h4></a></li>
